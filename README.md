This is my first big milestone using The Odin Project. I believe I have a solid grasp on flexbox to achieve a nice landing page!

rock paper scissors javascript project from the odin project. it took me about maybe 8 hours of coding and about the same of watching and studying concepts. the dom was actually easy to grasp. the hardest part was following the syntax of javascript without errors. most of the original code was good just not formatted in the correct way, which will get easier in time.

# [odin-etch-a-sketch](https://odin-etch-a-sketch-reitenth.netlify.app/)
Finished up the etch a sketch project. I started using the WakaTime extention to calculate time on project half way through. I think it took maybe 4-5 hours total with about the same in research; about half the time of the rock paper scissors. It was much easier understanding javascript logic and I felt really comfortable navigating the DOM. Still a lot of tools and it is tough knowing what to use, but I feel like that is coding in general, you will look up a lot of stuff. I moved to a dedicated study space during this project so lost about a week of coding, but that might have been good to digest concepts. Looking forward to finishing out the foundations course!
