**Time Spent:** 8 hrs coding and 8 hrs studying concepts

**What I Learned:** The basics of javascript. The DOM was scary at first but not as bad as I thought to grasp.

**What Was Difficult:** Following the syntax of javascript without errors. It took time to get things formatted to actually run correctly despite the code being okay.

**Time Spent:** 5 hrs coding and 5 hours studying concepts.

**What I Learned:** More DOM getting ingrained in me. I used grid as I was somewhat familiar with it from previous HTML knowledge despite it not being taught yet. 

**What Was Difficult:** Once again, the syntax. It is different than HTML/CSS and takes more time than writing code.

**Time Spent:** 10-12 hrs coding, not sure on studying but pretty close to the same amount probably. 

**What I Learned:** How to keep moving forward when I got stuck and frustrated. This was the first project where the puzzle pieces didn't fall into place and it took multiple days to grasp what was not very much actual code.

**What Was Difficult:** Toughest project so far. Getting things from the 'current' screen to 'previous' took time and some help from the folks on Discord.
