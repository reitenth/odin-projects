# odin-rock-paper-scissors
rock paper scissors javascript project from the odin project. it took me about maybe 8 hours of coding and about the same of watching and studying concepts. the dom was actually easy to grasp. the hardest part was following the syntax of javascript without errors. most of the original code was good just not formatted in the correct way, which will get easier in time.

# odin-recipes
this project is a basic html recipe template using lists.
