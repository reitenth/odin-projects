# odin-etch-a-sketch
Finished up the etch a sketch project. I started using the WakaTime extention to calculate time on project half way through. I think it took maybe 4-5 hours total with about the same in research; about half the time of the rock paper scissors. It was much easier understanding javascript logic and I felt really comfortable navigating the DOM. Still a lot of tools and it is tough knowing what to use, but I feel like that is coding in general, you will look up a lot of stuff. I moved to a dedicated study space during this project so lost about a week of coding, but that might have been good to digest concepts. Looking forward to finishing out the foundations course!
